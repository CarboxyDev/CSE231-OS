/*
 *  This file will be used to make a binary ("rm") for the unix-shell program
 *  The created binary will allow the shell to use the rm command (following the POSIX standard while missing many common features)
 *  The rm command will be used to primarily delete files but also remove folders recursively using some special flags
 *  Supported Flags: TBD
 *  Supported Edge cases:
 *      1. TBD
 *      2. TBD
 * 
 *  TODO: Implement the command
